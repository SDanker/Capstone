**Capstone Project: Evaluating the Impact of the Vaccination Process on the Incidence of COVID-19 Cases, Hospitalizations, and Deaths in Chile**

**Objective:** 
To investigate the relationship between the mass vaccination campaign in Chile and the subsequent reduction in the incidence of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.

**Background:** 
The global outbreak of the COVID-19 virus led nations worldwide to urgently seek solutions to curb its spread. Chile, like many other countries, initiated a mass vaccination campaign, hoping to reduce the severe consequences associated with the virus. Anecdotal evidence and preliminary data suggest a notable decrease in the incidence of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths post-vaccination. However, a comprehensive analysis is required to draw statistically significant conclusions.

**Hypothesis:**
We believe that the mass vaccination campaign has significantly contributed to a decline in the incidence of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in Chile.

**Significance:**

1. **Reinforcing Trust:** If this study can demonstrate a strong correlation or causation between vaccination and reduced COVID-19 consequences, it will bolster public confidence in vaccines and the science underpinning them.

2. **Informed Decision-making:** Authorities can utilize the findings from this research to make informed decisions regarding the continuation, modification, or expansion of vaccination campaigns in the present and future.

3. **Clarity for the Public:** Understanding the tangible benefits of vaccination campaigns provides society with a clearer picture of the path forward. This clarity can guide individual choices, public policy decisions, and collective sentiments towards a return to normalcy.

**Methodology:**
The study will employ a combination of quantitative research methods, analyzing datasets from the onset of the pandemic to the present day. We will compare the rates of COVID-19 incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths before and after the initiation of the vaccination campaign, controlling for other variables such as public health measures and virus variants.

**Expected Outcome:**
Through this research, we aim to provide clear, data-driven insights into the effects of the vaccination campaign in Chile, paving the way for informed decisions in both health policy and public perception.
